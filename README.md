Predict the sales by using Linear Regression Machine Learning model

Forecast prediction is predicting a future value based on past values and many other factors. Sales prediction with Python enables businesses to forecast future sales based on factors like advertising expenses, customer segmentation, and marketing platforms. Leveraging machine learning techniques, companies can analyze historical data, build predictive models, and make data-driven decisions to optimize marketing strategies, allocate resources efficiently, and maximize revenue potential. By continuously updating the models with new data, businesses can adapt to market dynamics and achieve better performance in a competitive environment.\
